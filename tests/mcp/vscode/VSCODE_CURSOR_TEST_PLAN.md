## 0. Automated Test Scripts

An executable test harness is provided alongside this plan in `test-scripts/`. It communicates directly with the evalhub-mcp binary over both transports using the MCP JSON-RPC protocol.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Configure
cp test-scripts/test.env.example test-scripts/test.env
vi test-scripts/test.env  # fill in binary path, token, tenant, backend URL, test data IDs

# 2. Generate client configs (VS Code + Cursor, stdio + HTTP)
./test-scripts/generate_client_configs.sh

# 3. Run all tests — stdio transport
./test-scripts/run_tests.sh stdio

# 4. Start HTTP server, then run HTTP tests
evalhub-mcp --transport http --host localhost --port 3001
./test-scripts/run_tests.sh http

# 5. Run both transports
./test-scripts/run_tests.sh

# 6. Run a single suite (e.g., resources only, stdio)
./test-scripts/run_tests.sh stdio 02

# 7. Run multiple suites (e.g., tools + errors, HTTP)
./test-scripts/run_tests.sh http 03,06
```

## 3. Test Environment Setup

### 3.1 VS Code — stdio Transport

Add to `.vscode/settings.json` or VS Code User Settings:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.mcp.servers": {
    "evalhub": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/path/to/evalhub-mcp",
      "env": {
        "EVALHUB_TOKEN": "<token>",
        "EVALHUB_TENANT": "<tenant>",
        "EVALHUB_BASE_URL": "https://evalhub.example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.2 VS Code — HTTP/SSE Transport

Start the server manually:

```bash
evalhub-mcp --transport http --host localhost --port 3001
```

Add to VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.mcp.servers": {
    "evalhub": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:3001/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Cursor — stdio Transport

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` (project-level) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "evalhub": {
      "command": "/path/to/evalhub-mcp",
      "env": {
        "EVALHUB_TOKEN": "<token>",
        "EVALHUB_TENANT": "<tenant>",
        "EVALHUB_BASE_URL": "https://evalhub.example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.4 Cursor — HTTP/SSE Transport

Start the server manually (same as VS Code):

```bash
evalhub-mcp --transport http --host localhost --port 3001
```

Add to Cursor MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "evalhub": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3001/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### 4.6 Error Scenarios

| ID | Priority | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | VS Code | Cursor |
|----|----------|-----------|-------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| ERR-01 | P0 | Server not running (HTTP) | 1. Configure HTTP transport. 2. Do NOT start the server. 3. Try to use a tool. | Client shows actionable error: "Cannot connect to evalhub server at localhost:3001" or similar. No silent failure. | [ ] | [ ] |
| ERR-02 | P0 | Invalid auth token | 1. Set `EVALHUB_TOKEN` to an invalid value. 2. Try to list providers. | Clear authentication error surfaced to user. Not a generic 500. | [ ] | [ ] |
| ERR-03 | P1 | Backend unreachable | 1. Set `EVALHUB_BASE_URL` to unreachable host. 2. Start server (should succeed). 3. Try to list resources. | Server starts normally. Operations return connectivity error with the target URL. | [ ] | [ ] |
| ERR-04 | P1 | Invalid binary path (stdio) | 1. Configure stdio with non-existent binary path. 2. Open client. | Client shows error that server binary was not found. | [ ] | [ ] |
| ERR-05 | P1 | Server crash mid-operation | 1. Start server in HTTP mode. 2. Kill server process during a long-running operation. | Client reports connection lost. Does not hang indefinitely. | [ ] | [ ] |
| ERR-06 | P2 | Expired auth token mid-session | 1. Start with valid token. 2. Invalidate/expire token server-side. 3. Make a new request. | Error message indicates auth failure; suggests re-authentication. | [ ] | [ ] |

---

### 4.7 End-to-End Workflow (Golden Path)

| ID | Priority | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | VS Code | Cursor |
|----|----------|-----------|-------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| E2E-01 | P0 | Full EDD cycle | In a single chat session: 1. Discover benchmarks labeled "rag". 2. Submit evaluation against a model endpoint. 3. Monitor job status. 4. Review experiment results. 5. Compare with a previous run using `compare_runs` prompt. 6. Cancel the job. | Each step completes successfully. Agent maintains context across the full workflow. | [ ] | [ ] |
| E2E-02 | P1 | Multi-tool orchestration | Ask agent: "Find all RAG benchmarks, pick the first one, and submit an evaluation against endpoint X." | Agent chains resource reads and tool calls in sequence without manual intervention. | [ ] | [ ] |
| E2E-03 | P1 | Prompt-to-action flow | Invoke `evaluate_model` prompt and follow through to job submission. | Prompt guides the agent to collect inputs and execute the submission tool. | [ ] | [ ] |

---

### 4.8 Client-Specific Behavior

| ID | Priority | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | VS Code | Cursor |
|----|----------|-----------|-------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| CS-01 | P1 | Transport payload parity | Run the same tool call via stdio and HTTP in the same client. Compare responses. | Payloads are identical regardless of transport. | [ ] | [ ] |
| CS-02 | P2 | Concurrent sessions | Open 2 chat windows, both using the same MCP server. | Both sessions can use tools/resources without interference. | [ ] | [ ] |
| CS-03 | P2 | Client restart recovery | 1. Connect to server. 2. Close and reopen client. | Server reconnects (HTTP) or relaunches (stdio) without manual reconfiguration. | [ ] | [ ] |
| CS-04 | P2 | Large response handling | Request a resource with 100+ items. | Client renders the full response without truncation or crash. | [ ] | [ ] |

| **Totals** | **43** | **19** | **19** | **5** | **172** |

## 6. Known Limitations to Investigate

Document findings for each during test execution:

1. **Autocompletion support** — GitHub Copilot MCP extension and Cursor may differ in how they surface completions for resource URIs
2. **Prompt template rendering** — Verify both clients render MCP prompt arguments UI correctly
3. **SSE reconnection** — Behavior when HTTP/SSE connection drops may vary by client
4. **Rate limiting** — Whether clients implement any request throttling to the MCP server
5. **stdio stderr handling** — How each client surfaces server-side log output
6. **Tool approval UX** — Whether clients prompt users before executing tools (Cursor has explicit tool approval; VS Code Copilot may differ)
7. **MCP protocol version** — Confirm both clients support the MCP protocol version used by evalhub-mcp

---

## 7. Exit Criteria

### Pass

- All **P0** tests pass on both clients across both transports
- No data loss or silent failures observed
- Setup commands documented and verified as copy-paste ready

### Conditional Pass

- All P0 pass; some P1 fail with documented workarounds or client-specific limitations logged

### Fail

- Any P0 test fails on either client
- Server crashes or hangs during normal operation
- Error messages are missing or non-actionable

## 9. Automated tests

```shell
make test-mcp-vscode
```

### What these scripts actually test

The harness under tests/mcp/vscode/test-scripts/ is an MCP protocol integration test against the evalhub-mcp binary:

- stdio: starts evalhub-mcp, talks over FIFOs with JSON-RPC (initialize, resources/*, tools/*, prompts/*, completion/complete, etc.).
- HTTP: curl to the same MCP endpoint the server exposes (Streamable HTTP), with a proper session (initialize → notifications/initialized → follow-up calls).

So they verify: the MCP server behaves the way a conforming MCP client would expect, for both transports.

### How that relates to “VS Code integration”

The link to VS Code is indirect:

1. `VSCODE_CURSOR_TEST_PLAN.md` describes manual checks in VS Code (Copilot MCP) and Cursor (settings, MCP panel, chat, etc.).
2. `run_tests.sh` + `tests/*.sh` automate the same protocol surface those clients use when they talk to evalhub-mcp — but without opening VS Code, without Copilot, and without UI.

So:

| Layer | Automated by test-scripts/? |
| :---- | :-------------------------- |
| evalhub-mcp JSON-RPC + stdio/HTTP | Yes |
| VS Code / Copilot UI, OAuth, extension bugs | No — test plan / manual |
| “Agent typed this in chat” | No |

### Why it’s still useful for VS Code

If stdio and HTTP both pass here, you’ve shown the server side of what VS Code’s MCP client will drive is consistent. Failures in VS Code that don’t reproduce here are more likely client/extension, config, or user flow issues — which is exactly what the markdown test plan is for.

**Summary**: these tests validate MCP server ↔ protocol client parity; they do not test VS Code itself. VS Code integration is covered by the written test plan (and manual runs), with the scripts acting as a fast, repeatable protocol baseline.

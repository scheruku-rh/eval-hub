  Scenario: Delete evaluation job behaviors
    Given I send a POST request to "/api/v1/evaluations/jobs" with body "file:/evaluation_job_basic.json"
    And the response code should be 202
    When I send a DELETE request to "/api/v1/evaluations/jobs/{id}?hard_delete=true"
    Then the response code should be 204

    And all ConfigMaps associated with the evaluation job should be deleted
    And the Job deletion should use propagationPolicy "Background"
    Given I send a POST request to "/api/v1/evaluations/jobs" with body "file:/evaluation_job_basic.json"
    And the response code should be 202

    Then the response code should be 204
    And the Jobs should still exist in Kubernetes
    And the ConfigMaps should still exist in Kubernetes
    Given I send a POST request to "/api/v1/evaluations/jobs" with body "file:/evaluation_job_multi_benchmark.json"
    And the response code should be 202

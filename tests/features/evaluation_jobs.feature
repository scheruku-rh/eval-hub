Feature: Evaluation Jobs
  As a data scientist
  I want to create evaluation jobs against a running cluster
  So that I evaluate models

  Background:
    Given I set the header "X-Tenant" to "{{env:X_TENANT|test-tenant}}"
    And I set the wait deadline to "{{env:WAIT_DEADLINE|30m}}"
    And the model endpoint is reachable
    # This is mandatory for the tests to run successfully
    And the value "{{env:MODEL_AUTH_SECRET_REF}}" is not empty

  Scenario: Verifying results returned for Evaluation job
    Given the service is running
    When I send a POST request to "/api/v1/evaluations/jobs" with body "file:/evaluation_job.json"
    Then the response code should be 202
    And the response should contain the value "pending" at path "$.status.state"
    And the response should contain the value "evaluation_job_created" at path "$.status.message.message_code"
    And I wait for the evaluation job status to be "completed"
    When I send a GET request to "/api/v1/evaluations/jobs/{id}"
    Then the response code should be 200
    And the response should contain the value "completed" at path "$.status.state"

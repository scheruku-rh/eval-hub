Feature: Evaluation Jobs
  As a data scientist
  I want to create evaluation jobs against a running cluster
  So that I evaluate models

  Background:
    Given I set the header "X-Tenant" to "{{env:X_TENANT|test-tenant}}"
    And I set the header "X-User" to "{{env:X_USER|test-user}}"
    And I set the wait deadline to "{{env:WAIT_DEADLINE|30m}}"
    And the model endpoint is reachable
    # This is mandatory for the tests to run successfully
    And the value "{{env:MODEL_AUTH_SECRET_REF}}" is not empty

    And the response should contain the value "{{env:X_TENANT|test-tenant}}" at path "$.resource.tenant"
    And the response should have schema from file "file:/schemas/evaluation_job_resource_connected.schema.json"

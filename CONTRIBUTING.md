## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

Eval Hub is an API REST server that serves as a routing and orchestration layer for evaluation backends. It supports flexible deployment options from local development to production Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters. Before contributing, familiarize yourself with:

- **Architecture**: Read the [README.md](README.md) for project overview
- **API Documentation**: See the bundled [OpenAPI spec](./docs/openapi.yaml) (generated from [docs/src/openapi.yaml](./docs/src/openapi.yaml)) or the [live docs](https://eval-hub.github.io/eval-hub/) for endpoint specifications
- **Deployment Options**: Understand local development, Podman, and Kubernetes/OpenShift deployment models

### Prerequisites

**Required for All Development:**

- Go 1.26.0+
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for build automation
- Git
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python virtual environment management (required by `make test-fvt`, `make start-service`, and pre-commit hooks)

**Optional for Container Testing:**

- Podman (for containerization testing)

**Optional for Cluster Integration Testing:**

- Access to a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster
- kubectl or oc CLI tools

## Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eval-hub.git
   cd eval-hub
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Download and tidy Go dependencies
   make install-deps
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**

   Local settings are layered from [config/config.yaml](config/config.yaml): you can set values directly in that file; override them with environment variables listed under the `env_mappings` key (each entry maps an env var name to a config path, for example `PORT` → `service.port`); and load sensitive values from files under `secrets.dir` using `secrets.mappings` (each entry maps a secret file basename in that directory to a config path). The repository does not include a committed `.env` file; use exported environment variables, secret files you place under `secrets.dir`, and/or edits to `config/config.yaml`, depending on what you need for local work or a cluster.

4. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. **Verify Setup**

   ```bash
   # Run tests to verify everything works
   make test

   # Start the development server (default port 8080)
   make start-service

   # Or use a custom port
   PORT=3000 make start-service
   ```

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in various forms:

### Types of Contributions

- **Bug Fixes**: Fix issues in existing functionality
- **Features**: Add new evaluation backends, API endpoints, or capabilities
- **Documentation**: Improve README, API docs, or add examples
- **Testing**: Add test coverage or improve test infrastructure
- **Performance**: Optimize existing code or reduce resource usage
- **DevOps**: Improve CI/CD, deployment, or monitoring

### Contribution Areas

1. **Backend Executors**: Add support for new evaluation frameworks
2. **API Endpoints**: Extend the REST API with new functionality
3. **Deployment Integration**: Improve local, Podman, or Kubernetes deployment and orchestration
4. **MLFlow Integration**: Enhance experiment tracking capabilities
5. **Monitoring**: Add metrics, logging, or health checks
6. **Documentation**: User guides, API documentation, examples

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create an Issue

Before starting work, create an issue to discuss:

- **Bug Reports**: Describe the problem with reproduction steps
- **Feature Requests**: Explain the use case and proposed solution
- **Architectural Changes**: See special requirements below
- **Questions**: Ask for clarification or guidance

#### Architectural Changes

**Definition**: Changes that affect system design, component interactions, or technology choices, including:

- New backend executors or evaluation frameworks
- API endpoint additions or modifications
- Database schema changes
- Deployment architecture updates
- New dependencies or technology stack changes
- Performance or security architectural decisions

**Required Process**:

1. **Create Issue**: Use `kind/architecture` label
2. **Discussion**: Allow community input and maintainer feedback in the issue
3. **Approval**: Maintainers add `status/accepted` label after discussion
4. **Implementation**: Only proceed with implementation after approval
5. **Closure**: Issues without approval will be closed with explanation

**Note**: Implementation PRs for architectural changes will only be accepted if the corresponding issue has `status/accepted` label.

### 2. Branch Strategy

```bash
# Create a feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 3. Development Process

1. **Write Tests First**: For new features, write tests before implementation
2. **Implement Changes**: Write code following our standards
3. **Test Locally**: Run full test suite and verify functionality
4. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation

### 4. Commit Guidelines

Use conventional commits:

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
git commit -m "feat(api): add collection-based evaluation endpoint"
git commit -m "fix(executor): handle timeout errors in NeMo evaluator"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update deployment instructions"
git commit -m "test(integration): add MLFlow integration tests"
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `ci`, `chore`

PRs targeting `main` are checked by [commitlint](.github/workflows/commitlint.yml) (Commitizen). Messages should follow this format; CI also allows subjects prefixed with `EH` (project convention) or `Merge` / `merge:` for merge commits.

If you have [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) installed, commit messages are also checked locally:

```bash
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

## Code Standards

### Code Quality Tools

We use automated tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code
make fmt

# Lint code
make lint

# Vet code
make vet

# Run all quality checks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Go Standards

- **Go Version**: Support 1.26.0+
- **Code Style**: Follow standard Go conventions (enforced by gofmt)
- **Error Handling**: Always check and handle errors explicitly
- **Documentation**: Use godoc-style comments for exported types and functions
- **Import Grouping**: Standard library, then external packages, then internal packages

### Code Organization

- **Packages**: Keep packages focused and cohesive
- **Dependencies**: Add new dependencies carefully
- **Error Handling**: Return errors explicitly; use error wrapping with `fmt.Errorf` and `%w`
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with zap (wrapped in slog interface)
- **Configuration**: Use Viper for configuration management

### Example Code Structure

```go
// Package handlers provides HTTP request handlers for evaluation operations.
package handlers

import (
  "github.com/eval-hub/eval-hub/internal/eval_hub/executioncontext"
  "github.com/eval-hub/eval-hub/internal/eval_hub/http_wrappers"
)

// HandleCreateEvaluation processes a create-evaluation request.
// Evaluation handlers use ExecutionContext plus request/response wrappers (not raw http.ResponseWriter).
func (h *Handlers) HandleCreateEvaluation(
  ctx *executioncontext.ExecutionContext,
  req http_wrappers.RequestWrapper,
  w http_wrappers.ResponseWrapper,
) {
  ctx.Logger.Info("Processing evaluation")
  // Parse body via req, call storage/runtime, write JSON via w
}
```

## Testing

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and packages (in `internal/`)
- **FVT (Functional Verification Tests)**: BDD-style tests using godog (in `tests/features/`). Scenarios are tagged (`@local_runtime`, `@local`, `@cluster`, `@mlflow`, `@negative`, `@gha-wheel-sanity`) to control which run in each context. The `@local_runtime` tag marks scenarios that need a fully functional local evaluation runtime (local mode / job execution, not Kubernetes); those scenarios are **skipped in the default FVT run** (`~@local_runtime` in `FVT_TAGS`). Opt in by overriding `FVT_TAGS` / `GODOG_TAGS` as documented in `tests/features/README.md`. The `@gha-wheel-sanity` tag marks scenarios executed during GHA wheel validation via `scripts/gha_wheel_sanity_test.sh` (that job passes its own `FVT_TAGS`, so it is unaffected by the default `~@local_runtime`). See `tests/features/README.md` for all tags and examples.
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests, FVT (godog), and FVT against a running server
make test-all

# Run only unit tests
make test

# Run only FVT tests (no server)
make test-fvt

# Generate FVT HTML report (requires Node dev deps)
npm ci
make fvt-report

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run specific unit test
go test -v ./internal/eval_hub/handlers -run TestHandleName

# Run specific FVT test
go test -v ./tests/features -run TestFeatureName
```

### Test Requirements

1. **New Features**: Must include unit and integration tests
2. **Bug Fixes**: Must include regression tests
3. **Coverage**: Aim for strong coverage; CI uploads reports to Codecov (`codecov.yml`). There is no hard minimum percentage enforced in the workflow today
4. **Performance**: Include performance tests for critical paths when relevant

### Test Structure

Use `httptest`, mocks, and test doubles as in `internal/eval_hub/handlers/*_test.go`. Handlers take `RequestWrapper` / `ResponseWrapper`, so tests typically build a `Handlers` instance and drive the wrapper types rather than calling `http.Handler` directly.

## OpenShift Deployment Testing

EvalHub can be deployed on OpenShift via the [TrustyAI operator](https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/trustyai-service-operator), which is included in [OpenDataHub](https://opendatahub.io/).

### Prerequisites for OpenShift

- Access to an OpenShift cluster
- Cluster admin permissions or sufficient RBAC permissions
- A container registry account (e.g., quay.io) for hosting your custom EvalHub image

### Deployment Steps

1. **Install OpenDataHub from OperatorHub**

   Install OpenDataHub 3.3 (recommended) from the OpenShift OperatorHub:
   - Navigate to Operators → OperatorHub in the OpenShift console
   - Search for "Open Data Hub"
   - Install version 3.3 (or latest stable version)

2. **Create a DataScienceCluster**

   Create a DataScienceCluster with the TrustyAI component enabled (enabled by default):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: datasciencecluster.opendatahub.io/v1
   kind: DataScienceCluster
   metadata:
     name: default-dsc
   spec:
     components:
       trustyai:
         managementState: Managed
   ```

3. **Build and Push Your EvalHub Image**

   Build your custom EvalHub image and push it to a container registry:

   ```bash
   # Build the image
   podman build -t quay.io/<your-username>/eval-hub:latest .

   # Push to registry
   podman push quay.io/<your-username>/eval-hub:latest
   ```

4. **Update Manifests with Custom Image**

   In your fork of the TrustyAI operator, update the `params.env` file in your manifests to reference your custom EvalHub image:

   ```env
   evalHubImage=quay.io/<your-username>/eval-hub:latest
   ```

5. **Configure Custom Image Reference**

   You have two options to use your custom image:

   **Option A: Using devFlags**

   Update your DataScienceCluster to reference your custom manifests:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: datasciencecluster.opendatahub.io/v1
   kind: DataScienceCluster
   metadata:
     name: default-dsc
   spec:
     components:
       trustyai:
         devFlags:
           manifests:
             - contextDir: config
               sourcePath: ""
               uri: "https://github.com/<your-org>/trustyai-service-operator/tarball/<your-branch>"
         managementState: Managed
   ```

   **Option B: Mount manifests directly**

   Update the manifest files with your custom image reference and mount them to the operator. See the [OpenDataHub Component Development Guide](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opendatahub-operator/blob/main/hack/component-dev/README.md) for details on mounting manifests.

6. **Deploy an EvalHub Custom Resource**

   Create an EvalHub CR to deploy your instance:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: trustyai.opendatahub.io/v1
   kind: EvalHub
   metadata:
     name: evalhub-instance
     namespace: <your-namespace>
   spec:
     database:
       type: postgresql
       secret: evalhub-db
     otel:
       exporterType: otlp-grpc
       exporterEndpoint: otel-collector.opentelemetry.svc:4317
       exporterInsecure: false
       samplingRatio: "1.0"
       enableTracing: true
       enableMetrics: true
       enableLogs: true
       tracerTimeout: "30s"
       tracerBatchInterval: "5s"
       metricExportInterval: "60s"
       serviceName: eval-hub
   ```

   When `spec.otel` is set, the [TrustyAI operator](https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/trustyai-service-operator) writes an `otel:` block into the EvalHub ConfigMap `config.yaml`. Field names use camelCase in the CR and map to eval-hub `otel.*` keys (see [OTEL.md](OTEL.md#openshift--trustyai-operator)).

   To export adapter container logs at job completion, `enable_logs` must be true (`enableLogs: true` above). Eval-hub also supports `otel.enable_job_container_logs` (see [`config/config.yaml`](config/config.yaml)); it has no effect unless `enable_logs` is enabled. That flag is not yet exposed on `spec.otel`—set it in the operator-generated `config.yaml` if needed until the CRD adds it.
